    The FBI is on the hunt for a dangerous cybercriminal, but they're keeping things under wraps. 
    All you have to go on is a blurry photo and the trail of chaos he's left behind.

    Your job? Uncover the national ID card country code and the country name of this elusive suspect. 
    This criminal is rumored to be behind major cyberattacks, extortion schemes, and disruptions 
    to critical infrastructure worldwide.

    The numbers in the flag are the key: they reveal his national ID card country code and his 
    country of origin.
