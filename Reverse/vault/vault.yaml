    Deep in the digital underground lies an ancient vault, its contents guarded by sophisticated security measures. Intelligence suggests it contains a crucial key needed to access the vault.
    
    The vault's lock mechanism employs advanced binary protection techniques, but rumors speak of a special key - one that combines both numbers and letters in an unexpected way.
    
    Your mission:
    - Reverse engineer the vault's security mechanism
    - Find the correct key to unlock the vault
    - You will get the flag once you enter the correct key
    
    Note: Brute force attempts will be futile. Understanding the binary's behavior is key.
