# Cryptography Challenges

Welcome to our cryptography challenges repository! Here, we present two exciting challenges: Classic Cipher and RSA Attack.

## Challenges

### 1. Classic Cipher: Twin Hex Cipher

In this challenge, you will decode a text encrypted using the Twin Hex Cipher. The encoded text will be provided, and your goal is to decrypt it to obtain the flag.

### 2. RSA Attack: Small Exponent Attack

This challenge involves exploiting the Small Exponent Attack on RSA. Your task is to analyze the provided RSA parameters and recover the flag.
